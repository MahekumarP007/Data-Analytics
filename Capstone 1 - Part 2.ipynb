    "- Feedback will be provided on 3 levels (Awesome, Suggestion, & Required). Required changes are mandatory to be made.\n",

    "# HR Analytics: Understanding Employee Attrition\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "The purpose of this analysis is to understand the factors contributing to employee attrition at the company. By exploring different variables such as age, income, tenure, and job satisfaction, we aim to identify patterns that may help reduce turnover.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "We will use SQL queries to analyze the dataset, focusing on key areas like age groups, pay levels, and tenure years. Each analysis step will be documented with observations and insights derived from the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Age-Based Attrition Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analyzing Attrition by Age Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thought Process\n",
    "We begin by examining the age distribution of employees who leave the company. Specifically, we want to understand why more employees over the age of 50 are leaving compared to those aged 40-50.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Query Explanation\n",
    "The following SQL query categorizes employees into two age groups: 'Over 50' and '40-50'. It calculates the total number of employees, the number of those who left, and the attrition rate for each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Pay-Based Attrition Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analyzing Attrition by Pay Levels\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thought Process\n",
    "Despite the assumption that higher pay should lead to better retention, some well-paid employees still leave the company. We want to investigate this phenomenon by comparing attrition rates among employees with above-average and below-average pay.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Query Explanation\n",
    "The following query divides employees into two pay levels based on the average monthly income. It then calculates the attrition rate for each level to see if higher pay correlates with lower attrition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tenure-Based Attrition Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analyzing Factors Driving Attrition for Employees with Less than 5 Years at the Company\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thought Process\n",
    "Newer employees (those with less than 5 years of tenure) are often at higher risk of leaving as they adjust to the company culture and work environment. We will explore which factors, such as job satisfaction or work-life balance, are most correlated with attrition in this group.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Query Explanation\n",
    "The following query filters employees with less than 5 years at the company and groups them by various satisfaction metrics to calculate the attrition rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis provided valuable insights into the factors driving employee attrition at the company. By focusing on age groups, pay levels, and tenure, we identified specific areas where the company can take action to improve employee retention. These findings should guide HR policies and interventions aimed at reducing turnover.\n",
